1.ssms is not a server by itself.it is a client tool which is
used to connect to the database server.

2.whenever we create a database two files are created automatically,
	mdf-master data file
	ldf-log data file
	create database database_name;
	alter database database_name set single_user with rollback immediate;
	alter database database_name modify name='new_name'
			(or)
	sp_renamedb 'oldname','new name'  

3.foreign key is used to make data integrity and intact
  whatever the data entered into the table is checked in the
  primary column of the referenced table 
  
	alter table table1_name add constraint constraint_name
	foreign key(table1_name_column) references table2_name(table2_name_column)

4.default constraint:if you do not enter the value then the default value will be kicked in
	
	alter table table_name add constraint constraint_name Default default_value for column_name
  to add new column:
	alter table table_name add column_name data_type
  to drop constraint:
        alter table table_name drop constraint constraint_name

5.cascading referential integrity:
	if the values in the referenced table is deleted/updated then the records in the foreign key 
  table become the orphan records.
	by default four actions are performed:
	1.noaction--no action is performed.
	2.setdefault--sets to default value.
	3.setnull--sets to null
	4.cascade--deletes/updates to the latest value.
	
	alter table table_name add constraint constraint_name
	foreign key(column) references table1_name(column)
	on delete set default/cascade

6.Check constraint is used to check the values before inserting into the table
  the value to be checked to be an boolean expression
	alter table table_name add constraint constraint_name CHeck (expression)

7.identity:value can be incremented based on the seed and increment value.
	create table tbl_name(column_name data_type identity(seed,increment))
  deleting the values in the table doesn't reset the identity column
  to fill the gaps in the identity row use:
   SET identity_insert tbl_name ON;& values to the table should be provided along with the column names
   when identity_insert is turned ON we cannot insert the values by not providing the identity column value.
  To reset the identity value use:
	DBCC checkident(tbl_name,RESEED,0)

8.to generate the identity value:
   scope_identity():it will return the identity value with in the same statement scope and same session
   @@identity:it will return the identity value with in the same session across any scope
   ident_current('tbl_name'):it will return the identity value for the particular table across any session

9.Unique key:Since a table contains only one primary key.to maintain uniqueness across all the columns unique key is used.
   unique key allows one null value.
  alter table tbl_name add constraint constraint_name unique(column_name)

10.Select:
   when distinct is used for two or more columns then the distinct values are returned across all the columns specified.
   if there are multiple filter use IN.
   Between 10 and 25 will return the values in between 10&25 and 10 value & 25 value.
   wildcards:
   %-represents occurence of zero or more characters
   _-represents occurence of exactly one character.
   to select the name's that start with the specified characters
    select * from table where name like '[MST]%'-- retrives names start with M,S,T
    doesn't start with MST use '[^MST]%'
   order by-- used to sort the results either in asc(default) or desc order.
   sort the order of two or more columns by:
   select * from tblPerson orderby name asc,Age desc
   If a table has large number of rows retrieving the data takes lot of time if you want to retrieve the sample data use top keyword.
   select top 10 * from table_name
   (or)
   select top 10 name,age from tblPerson

11.


note points::
1.a table can have only one primary key but more than one unique key.
2.while selecting entire column list use entire column list rather than using "*"
  this will help in improving the performance of the query.
3.to return the highest salary of the person in the table:
  select top 1 * from tblPerson order by salary desc
