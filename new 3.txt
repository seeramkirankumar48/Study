public class Student{
int i;
String name;

}


1.types of instantation of objects::
-------------------------------------
A.by using the object reference variable
	Student s=new Student();
	s.i=100;//instantation using object reference variable.
B.By using the methods.
	void insert(int _i,String _name)
	{
		i=_i;
		name=_name;
	}
	
	Student s=new Student();
	s.insert(1,"yyyy");//instantation using methods
C.By using the constructors.
	Student(int _i,string _name)
	{
		i=_i;
		name=_name;
	}
	Student s=new Student(1,"yyyy"); // instantation through constructors
	if it is a default constructor then the default values will be assigned to the instance variables.

	
2.Different types of variables creation::
-------------------------------------------
A.local variables --- variables inside the methods
B.instance variables -- variables at class level but outside the methods (memory is allocated at the time of creation of object)
c.static variables

3.Different types of creation of objects::
-------------------------------------------
A.By using new keyword
B.By using newInstance() method
C.by using clone() method
D.by using Factory() methods
E.By deserialization.

4.Ways of copying values from one constructor to another constructor:::
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A.By using Constructor
Student(student s)
{
i=s.i;
name=s.name;
}

Student s=new Student(1,"yyyy");
Student s1=new Student(s);

B.By using instance variables.
Student s=new Student(1,"yyyy");
Student s1=new Student();
s1.i=s.i;
s1.name=s.name;

C.Clone() method of object class

5.Restrictions for static method::
-----------------------------------
A.The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
B.this and super cannot be used in static context.

KeyPoints
-------------
1.Constructor returns the current class instance.
2.All the objects are created in the Heap memory and the reference variables are created in the stack. for static variables the memory is allocated in the ClassArea.
3.The static variables are commonly shared across all the objects of that particular class.
4.java static block is called even before the constructors of the class.
5.Static keyword is mainly used for memory management.
6.IF we make any method final we cannot override it.
7.if we make a class final we cannot extend it.
8.if a class extends another class that contains the final method, this final method can be invoked in the subclass,but it cannot be overrided.
9.a blank final variable is that it is declared in the class without initialization.
10.to instate a blank final variable we can do that in the constructor.if it is static final variable, then we can instantiate using the static block.
11.Runtime polymorphism can't be achieved for data members.
12.If there is any method declared as abstract then the class must be declared as abstract class.

Things to learn
-------------------
1.this keyword.
2.InstanceOf operator.
