3.Boolean occupies 1 bit of memory,char occupies 16 bits
4.Verbatim literal eliminates the escape sequences and prints the statement as specified.
	cw(@"Hello\n123")--Hello\n123
6.to store the nullable types into the datatypes
	use:: int? i=null;
  By default the integral data types are not allowed to store the null values.
7.to convert the string datatypes to integer data types we can use int.Parse() or int.TryParse() Methods
	int.parse(string s)
	int.TryParse returns bool value whether the parsing is successful or not and stores the output in the out variable

	bool b=int.TryParse(string s,out result) 
8.Arrays are used to store the homogenous type of data
  Arrays once initialized cannot grow in size
  Arrays are strongly typed.
  int[] Arr=new int[3];
  Arr[0]=0;
  Arr[1]=1;
  Arr[2]=2;
  //initialize and assign in the same line.
  int[] Odd={1,3,5};
9.Single line comments -//
  multi line comments - /* */
  xml comments - ///
15.foreach is used to iterate through the collection
	foreach(int item in Arr)
	{
	cw(item);
	}
   //value is retrieved from Arr in each iteration and gets stored in the item.
17.different types of method parameters::
	value parameters:: creates a copy of the parameters
	reference parameters:: variables point to the same address
	out parameters::when there is more than one return value.
	Parameter arrays:: takes a variable number of parameters
	public void fun(params int[] arr)
	{
	//
	}
	fun() // Pass-without arguments
	fun(1,2,3) // Pass- List of arguments
	int[] arr=new int[3];
	fun(arr) //Pass-passing of array as an argument
 Note:: there should not be more than one params keyword in the method.
	if there are multiple arguments in the method then the params keyword should be the last one.
 Diff b/w ref and out keyword::
	for ref the values are initialized before the method calling and can be intialized in the method.
	for out the values should be initialized in the method.

18.Namespaces are used to Organize the Code.
   Namespaces are used to avoid name clashes.
	To avoid name clashes use
	1.Fully Qualified name ProjectA.TeamA.ClassA.Print();
	2.namespace Alias--using PATA=ProjectA.TeamA;
			   PATA.ClassA.Print();
   NameSpaces doesn't correspond to filename/assembly. They can be written in the separate files but belong to the same namespace.

19.Classes are used to create the Custom data types
   Constructors are used to intialize the class fields during creation of the object.
   Constructors donot have return Value and should have the same name of the class Name.
   By Default a default Constructor is provided by .NET compiler.
   If we provide our own only Constructor(parameterized) then the default constructor will not be provided by .NET, Eventhough if we
     want the default constructor then we need to create the default constructor.
   Constructors are overloaded by Number and type of parameters
   Calling of parameterized constructor by default constructor::
	class Customer
    {
        string firstName;
        string lastName;
        public Customer():this("no fname","no lname")
        {

        }
       
        public Customer(string fname,string lname)
        {
            this.firstName = fname;
            this.lastName = lname;
        }
        public void FullName()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("FullName ={0}",this.firstName+" "+this.lastName);
        }
    }

20.If something that was not changed on per object basis then it is wise to declare that field as static.If it was declared as static 
   then that particular field is shared across multiple objects results in performance of the application.
   Note: Static Constructor is used to initialize the static fields of the class.
	 Static Constructor is called once and only one time eventhough there are multiple class instances.
	 this keyword is not used to refer the static fields.
   	 Static Constructors are called even before the instance Constructors.
  	 Access modifiers("public","private") should not be used before the Static Constructors because they are called evenbefore 
	 the instantation of object.

21.Inheritance is used to allow code reuse.
	All the common code goes into the Base Class and specialized classes are "Derived" classes.
	A class can be inherited from another class using ':'
        class Parent
	{
	}
	class Child:Parent
	{
	}  
	While Creating of the Child Class object the Parent Class Constructor is called followed by child class constructor.
	Child Class is a specialized class of Parent Class.
	C# doesn't Supports multiple class inheritance.
	to call the Base class specific constructor(parameterized) use "base" keyword for the child class Constructor
	class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Child c = new Child("Kiran");
        }
    }

   class Parent
    {
        public Parent()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Parent Class Default Constructor");
        }
        public Parent(string message):this()
        {
            
            Console.WriteLine("Parent Class parameterized Constructor"+message);
        }
    }
    class Child:Parent
    {
        public Child()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Child Class Default Constructor");
        }
        public Child(string message2):base(message2)
        {
            
            Console.WriteLine("Child Class parameterized Constructor");
        }
    }

	o/p::Parent Class Default Constructor
	     Parent Class parameterized ConstructorKiran
	     Child Class parameterized Constructor

22.Method Hiding::when there are methods with the same name in both of the Parent class and Child class, the child class method 
		  hides the parent class method.
	There will be a warning if the hiding is intentional use new keyword to hide the child class method.
	while an object is created the child method is invoked cozz., the parent class method is hidden.
	to invoke the parent class method use::
	1.base.parentclass_method();
		 base.FullName();
		 //Console.WriteLine(this.firstName + " " + this.LastName + "-Contractor");
	2.casting the object reference of the child class with the parent class.
		  PTE pte = new ConsoleApplication2.PTE();
            	  pte.firstName = "Kiran";
            	  pte.LastName = "Seeram";
            
            	  ((Employee)pte).FullName();
	3.parent class reference variable pointing to the child class object.
		   Employee pte = new ConsoleApplication2.PTE();
            	   pte.firstName = "Kiran";
            	   pte.LastName = "Seeram";
            
            	   pte.FullName();

	//code
		class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee pte = new ConsoleApplication2.PTE();
            pte.firstName = "Kiran";
            pte.LastName = "Seeram";
            
            pte.FullName();
        }
    }

    class Employee
    {
       public string firstName;
       public  string LastName;
        public void FullName()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(this.firstName+" "+this.LastName);
        }
    }

    class FTE : Employee
    {

    }
    class PTE:Employee
    {
        int hrlyRate;
        public new void FullName()
        {
            base.FullName();
            Console.WriteLine(this.firstName + " " + this.LastName + "-Contractor");
        }
    }

23.Polymorphism:: polymorphism enables us to get the derived class methods with the parent class reference variables during runtime.
	for this the parent class method needs to be virtual and child class methods needs to be override
	virtual keyword indicates that the methods in the derived class can be overrided if needed.
	class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Employee[] employees = new Employee[3];
            employees[0] = new Employee();
            employees[1] = new FTE();
            employees[2] = new PTE();
            foreach(Employee emp in employees)
            {
                emp.FullName();
            }
            PTE pte = new ConsoleApplication2.PTE();
            pte.FullName();
        }
    }

    class Employee
    {
       public string firstName="FN";
       public  string LastName="LN";
        public virtual void FullName()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(this.firstName+" "+this.LastName);
        }
    }

    class FTE : Employee
    {

    }
    class PTE:Employee
    {
        int hrlyRate;
        public override void FullName()
        {
           
            Console.WriteLine(this.firstName + " " + this.LastName + "-Contractor");
        }
    }

24.Method overriding vs method hiding::
	method overriding::when a parent class reference variable points to the child class object the child class method is invoked
			   with the parent class reference variable(similar to polymorphism)
	method hiding::when a parent class reference variable points to the child class object the parent class method is invoked due
		       to which the parent class reference variable is pointing to the child class object even though the method is 
		       hidden in the derived class.

25.Method Overloading:: method overloading allows a class to have multiple functions with the same name.
	method overloading can happen with the number,type(data_type),kind(ref,out,Value) called as signature.
	method overloading cannot happen with the return type and with params keyword.
